README: Andrew Beinstein

perceptron.py: Main code, that has both the linear and kernel perceptron
implementations, as well as the code that generated the plots.

hw4.pdf: The write-up

plots: A directory of plots. Most of these plots were not used in the final writeup, but it's where I saved most of the plots I generated.

data: The provided data files, and my generated predictions.

data/test200.label.linear.35: The predictions made by the linear perceptron.

data/test200.label.kernel.35: The predictions made by the kernel perceptron. 

To try my functions, call them with the premade 'train' and 'label' variables 
in the main function.
